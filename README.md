## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I wanted to practice CSS grid and Flexbox to reproduce a clean, dynamic layout. I tried to give a class to as many elements as possible in order for CSS to be understood clearly, and to be able to target styles to specific elements.

### Continued development

I want to practice more with device-width cutoffs and grid responsiveness. I attempted to use the auto-fit and auto-fill properties, along with minmax, but I didn't quite have a grasp on this. I want to get some more practice with these in order to make dynamic grids that look great on different screen sizes.
